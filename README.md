# Smart Task Manager: A Dynamic Load Balancer 🚀

Ever wondered how your computer handles multiple tasks at once? This project shows you exactly that! Think of it as a smart assistant that helps your computer work more efficiently by distributing tasks across different processors - just like a good manager distributing work among team members.

## What Does It Do? 🤔

Imagine you're managing a team where:
- Some people are great at math (compute-intensive tasks)
- Others are great at organizing large amounts of information (memory-intensive tasks)
- And some excel at communication (IO-intensive tasks)

This program does exactly that with your computer's processors! It:
- 🎯 Assigns tasks to the most suitable processor
- 📊 Keeps track of how busy each processor is
- 🌡️ Monitors their temperature and energy use
- ⚖️ Makes sure no processor is overwhelmed

## What Makes It Special? ✨

- **Smart Task Distribution**: Like a good manager, it knows which processor is best for each task
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Keeps an eye on everything happening in your system
- **Automatic Balancing**: If one processor gets too busy, it helps redistribute the work
- **Health Checks**: Monitors temperature and power usage to keep everything running smoothly

## Getting Started 🚀

### What You'll Need
- Python 3.7 or newer
- Two simple packages:
  ```
  psutil - to talk to your computer's processors
  typing - to help Python understand our code better
  ```

### Setting It Up
1. Get the code:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd OS_PROJECT
   ```

2. Install what you need:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running It 🏃‍♂️
Just type:
```bash
python load_balancer.py
```

And watch it go! You'll see:
- Tasks being assigned to different processors
- Real-time updates on what's happening
- How well each processor is performing
- Final results showing how efficiently everything worked

## How It Works 🔧

Think of it as a busy kitchen where:
1. **Orders (Tasks)** come in with different requirements
2. **Chefs (Processors)** have different specialties
3. The **Head Chef (Load Balancer)** makes sure:
   - Each dish goes to the right cook
   - No one gets overwhelmed
   - Everything runs smoothly
   - The kitchen stays at the right temperature

## What You'll See 👀

When you run the program, you'll get to see:
- Tasks being assigned (like orders in a kitchen)
- How quickly they're completed
- If any tasks failed (like a dropped plate!)
- How hot each processor got
- How much energy was used

It's like having a window into your computer's brain! 🧠
